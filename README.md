## How it works
### 1. Get assignment/personal project
- Peers are going to come up with assignment projects of their own
- Peers are going to work on previous assignments given by lecturer

### 2. Submit your code
- Fork the repository
- Create a folder with your name or Github username under `/submissions/`
- Add your code to your repo
- Open a **Pull Request** to merge your folder into `main`

### 3. Review a Peer's Code
- Go to the "Pull Request" tab
- Choose an open PR from someone else
- Download their file project and test it on your own
- After testing, click "Review Changes" in the PR tab and leave helpful comments

> Tip: Use the [Code Review Checklist](#checklist) below to guide your feedback.

### 4. Discuss and learn
- Engage in back-and-forth discussion on comments
- Refactor code based on suggestions
- You can also open **Issues** to ask broader coding questions
